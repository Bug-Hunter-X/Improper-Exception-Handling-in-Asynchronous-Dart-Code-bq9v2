# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: insufficient exception handling. The `bug.dart` file shows code that makes an HTTP request but only prints exceptions instead of handling them effectively.  The `bugSolution.dart` file presents an improved version with better exception management.

## Problem

The original code lacks robust error handling.  Exceptions during the HTTP request are caught, but only printed to the console, which is insufficient for production applications.  This can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes.

## Solution

The solution improves error handling by:

1. Providing more informative error messages.
2. Implementing a retry mechanism for transient network issues.
3. Allowing calling functions to handle the exception in a controlled manner using `rethrow`. 

This approach makes the code more reliable and easier to debug.
